# This is the unique pattern ID.
#
# It is possible to define multiple patterns in a YML file, each with it's own
# unique ID. However, I personally think that it is more logical to have one
# pattern per file to keep them well-separated and organized.
#
# You can however, group similar patterns in a file.
# Example:
#   - button
#   - button_with_icon
#
button2:
  # The label and description are used in the Drupal UI and the pattern library.
  label: "Button 2"
  description: "Buttons to be used as needed. It includes options for color. https://italia.github.io/bootstrap-italia/docs/componenti/buttons/"

  # Variants definition.
  variants:
    link:
      label: Link
      description: 'Button with tag <a>'
    input:
      label: Input
      description: 'Button with tag <input>'
    button:
      label: Bottone
      description: 'Button with tag <button>'

  # Settings (ui_patterns_settings module).
  settings:
    color:
      type: select
      label: Color variants
      allow_expose: true
      options:
        primary: Primary
        secondary: Secondary

  # Fields of data supported by the pattern.
  # This can include optional fields which you can handle in your TWIG.
  fields:
    button_text:
      type: text
      label: 'Button text'
      description: 'Button text.'
      preview: 'Go to...'
    button_href:
      type: text
      label: 'Button link'
      description: 'Button link for link variant.'
      preview: 'https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap_italia'

  # Optional: Attached libraries.
  #
  # You can include libraries defined by other modules / themes with dependencies.
  #
  # These libraries are also available for include in theme libraries as
  # dependencies. Doing this ensures that the CSS / JS for the pattern are loaded
  # irrespective of whether a pattern of that type appears on the page.
  #   Example: ui_patterns/button.button
  # libraries:
  #   -
  #     card_simple:
  #       css:
  #         component:
  #           css/card_simple.css: {}

  # Optional: Specify a TWIG template with 'use'.
  #
  #   Example:
  #     use: 'themes/custom/THEME/patterns/blockquote/blockquote.html.twig'
  #
  # This usually contains a path relative to the Drupal root. Some documentation
  # says that a theme-relative path can also be used, but it didn't work for me.
  #
  #   Example:
  #     use: '@oldie/patterns/blockquote/blockquote.html.twig' (didn't work)
  #
  # Alternatively, you can use the 'components' module to have better-looking
  # and flexible paths.
  #
  #   Examples:
  #     use: '@patterns/blockquote/blockquote.html.twig'
  #     use: '@blockquote/blockquote.html.twig'
  #
  # Not defining 'use' makes the UI Patterns module look for a template with
  # the name 'pattern-PATTERN.html.twig. Underscores are changed into dashes.
  #
  #   Example: pattern-blockquote.html.twig
